## Executive Summary

Project has moderate drift: 8 stale priority issues and 20% plan completion despite 6 months of development. Strong code health (tests + CI) but documentation lags implementation significantly.

**Key Numbers:**
- Drift Areas: 3
- Critical Gaps: 2
- Work Items: 23
- Features Aligned: 12

## Issues to Close (Already Done)

- #45: Add user authentication - Implemented in src/auth/login.js
- #23: Setup CI pipeline - Working in .github/workflows/ci.yml
- #67: Add error handling - Completed across all route handlers

## Phases Marked Complete But NOT Actually Done

### Phase 2: Authentication
**Status in docs**: Complete
**Actual status**: INCOMPLETE
**Missing**:
- [ ] Password reset functionality (no code in auth/)
- [ ] Session timeout handling (hardcoded, not configurable)
- [ ] Tests for login flow (0 test files for auth/)

## Release Blockers

If you're planning to ship v1.0:
1. Security issue #78 (SQL injection in search) - MUST fix before any release
2. No tests for payment module - 0% coverage on critical path
3. Phase 2 auth incomplete - users can't reset passwords

## Issues That Need Attention

- #34: Stale 90+ days, assigned but no activity
- #56: Marked "in progress" since October, no commits
- #89: Duplicate of #45, can be closed

## Quick Wins

Things you can do right now:
1. Close issues #45, #23, #67 (already done)
2. Update PLAN.md Phase 2 status to "In Progress"
3. Close #89 as duplicate of #45
4. Add basic test for src/auth/login.js

## Formatting Guidelines

1. **Be specific**: Use issue numbers, file paths, function names
2. **Quantify**: "8 issues" not "many issues"
3. **Prioritize visually**: Critical items first, use bold
4. **Actionable**: Every finding should have a recommendation
5. **Evidence-based**: Cite specific sources for each claim
